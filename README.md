# Genetic Images

A simple program I have created out of boredom.
It is using genetic algorithm crossover and mutation to generate 
images based on a feedback from a user.

All of the generated images are stored in tmp folder in program directory.
It was compiled and tested on Linux but since it is made with Qt, it should
run on Windows or MacOS.
